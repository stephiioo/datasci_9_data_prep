# datasci_9_data_prep

## objective: the goal of this assignment was to focus on selecting datasets suitable for a machine learning experiment, with an emphasis on data cleaning, encoding, and transformation steps necessary to prepare the data. Since proper data preparation is crucial in machine learning and can significantly impact the performance of our models, we were to pay attention to the details of each dataset and the specific requirements of the machine learning tasks we plan to perform.
